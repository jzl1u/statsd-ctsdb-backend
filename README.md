============================

Elasticsearch backend for statsd

## Overview

This backend allows [Statsd][statsd] to save to [Elasticsearch][elasticsearch].  Supports dynamic index creation per day and follows the logstash naming convention of statsd-YYYY.MM.DD for index creation.

## History 

Originally written by Github user rameshpy, this library was created as a feature branch of etsy/statsd.  The statsd project recommended that this library be converted to its own repository as all other backends currently do.  This repository started as a restructuring of the existing feature branch into a standalone backend repository. Reconstructed from https://github.com/markkimsal/statsd-elasticsearch-backend
